        <h2 class="sous-titre">Achievements of <span class="nowrap">Sejong the Great (세종대왕) life</span></h2>
        <div class="success">
          <ul>
            <li><strong class="bold">Early life</strong><span>Born on 10 April 1397,which was later adjusted to 15 May, after Korea's adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1896.<br>
            Sejong was the son of King Taejong by his wife, Queen Wongyeong. When he was twelve, he became Grand Prince Chungnyeong (충녕대군).
            <br>
            his free spirited nature as well as his preference for hunting and leisure activities resulted in his removal from the position in June 1418.
            <br>
            However, even in retirement he continued to influence government policy. Sejong's surprising political skill and creativity did not become apparent until after his father's death in 1422.</span></li>
            <li><strong class="bold">Religion</strong><span>Sejong reorganized the government by appointing people from different social classes as civil servants.Furthermore, he performed government ceremonies according to Confucianism, and encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of Confucius</span></li>
            <li><strong class="bold">Economy</strong><span>In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the economy was based on a barter system with cloth, grain, and cotton being the most common forms of currency. In 1423, under King Sejong’s administration, the government attempted to develop a national currency modeled off of the Tang dynasty's kaiyuan tongbao (開元通寶)</span></li>
            <li><strong class="bold">Military</strong><span>King Sejong was an effective military planner. He created various military regulations to strengthen the safety of his kingdom,[15] and supported the advancement of military technology, including cannon development. Different kinds of mortars and fire arrows were tested as well as the use of gunpowder.</span></li>
            <li><strong class="bold">Hangul <div class="wrap-word">(한글)</div></strong><span>King Sejong profoundly affected Korea's history with the creation and introduction of hangul, the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language. Although it is widely assumed that he ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent the script, contemporaneous records such as the Veritable Records of King Sejong and Jeong In-ji's preface to the Hunminjeongeum Haerye emphasize that Sejong invented it himself.</span></li>
